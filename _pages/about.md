Hi! I am Fulvio Sanguigni! I am a Phd student, part of [AImageLab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/) at [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/)!
My work is focused on vision and language technologies.

I have a background in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Sapienza University of Rome. I have visited [Φ-Lab](https://philab.esa.int/) at [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) in 2022-2023 as a thesist.
I graduated with a thesis on Diffusion Models for Earth Observation Data, supervised by [Irene Amerini](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/ireneamerini) (Sapienza) and co-supervised by [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/) (Φ-Lab).

My research interests lie in the field of generative models (and more in general, large language and vision models). I am currently exploring also 3D deep learning, human pose estimation and domain adaptation strategies.

In the meanwhile, I delve into sports firstly for passion, secondly for the remarkable benefits of living a student-athlete life and finally for sake of competition.
You can find more in my athlete page and in several blog posts.
