Hi! I am Fulvio Sanguigni, a Phd in the National Phd in Artificial Intelligence at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, AImageLab.
I graduated in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Sapienza University of Rome, and I spent more than six months at European Space Agency working on my thesis, "Diffusion Models for Generating and Augmenting Earth Observation Data: a few use-cases".

In a few words: I work at the intersection between vision and language; nowadays, foundation models are pushing further the frontiers of multimodality AI systems, and I want to address some central challenges both in terms of design choices and in terms of applications domains.
I truly believe that a Phd is the result of deep expertise in one field together with ingenuity and curiosity. In this way, I can leverage interesting findings from other domains into my main research track. To this end, my research interests lie in the field of generative models, pose estimation approaches, 3D deep learning and Domain Adaptation techniques.

Together with my studies, I am an endurance athlete (cycling, running, triathlon) and, more in general, I pursue movement and physical development in all its forms and expressions. At the same time, the competitive side of sport complete my life as a student-athlete. There are valuable lessons to be acquired in the quest for excellence, and doing it in both disciplines creates the foundation for a rich and meaningful life.
