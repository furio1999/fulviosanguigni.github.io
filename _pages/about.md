Hi! I am Fulvio Sanguigni! I am a Phd student at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia!
My work is focused on vision and language technologies.
You can find me at AImageLab.

I have a background in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Sapienza University of Rome. I have visited European Space Agency, $$/Phi$$-Lab.
I graduated with a thesis on Diffusion Models for Earth Observation Data, supervised by Irene Amerini (Sapienza) and co-supervised by Bertrand Le Saux (@F-Lab).

My research interests lie in the field of generative models (and more in general, large language and vision models). I am currently exploring also 3D deep learning, human pose estimation and domain adaptation strategies.

In the meanwhile, I delve into sports firstly for passion, secondly for the remarkable benefits of living a student-athlete life and for sake of competition.
You can find more in my athlete page and in several blog posts.
